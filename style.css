 * We will not be using vanilla CSS. We're using Sass
 * 
 * The theme optimized to use with CSS Compass Framework http://compass-style.org/
 * Read how to use Compass to editing SCSS in this theme: http://foundationtheme.tadam.co.il/ *
 *
 * Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features
 * such as variables, nested selectors and loops. It's also
 * the easiest way to customize Foundation.
 *
 * All Sass files are located in the /scss folder.
 *
 * More info on how to use Sass with Foundation can be found here:
 * http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html
 *
 * if you for some reason would like to write plain css instead of using Sass,
 * you could just enqueue this file (style.css) to the header and add your styles in this file
